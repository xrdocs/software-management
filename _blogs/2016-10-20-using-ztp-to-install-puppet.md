title: Using ZTP to install Puppet
---
## Introduction
Puppet can potentically manage any resource defined on a node. Puppet can manage complex and distributed components to ensure service consistency and availability. In short, Puppet uses a configuration policy (a recipe) to bring system into compliance.

Puppet enables you to make a lot of changes both quickly and consistently. Unlike scripts, you don’t have to write out every step, you only have to define how it should be. You are not required to write out the process for evaluating and verifying different conditions. Instead, you utilize the Puppet configuration language to declare the final state of the resources. This is why Puppet is often described as declarative.

The difference between a declarative language and a procedural language: You tell Puppet the desired end results, not the steps to get there.

If you choose to use Puppet as your configuration platform, it is important to have the agent installed on the devices as quickly as possible and not use any scripting beyond the installation procedure of the agent.

## Puppet in IOS-XR
Puppetlabs have created a puppet agent for the IOS-XR Yocto based Linux. You can follow their installation innstructions here:
[Installing Cisco IOS-XR agents](https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/install_iosxr.html "Installing Cisco IOS-XR agents"). Make sure you download the file which has “cisco-wrlinux-7” in the filename, this is the version that works in the IOS-XR Yocto Linux environment.

If you are interested in using Puppet in conjonction with the YANG data models in JSON/XML format, have a look at the tutorial on Puppet and ciscoyang [Using Puppet with IOS-XR 6.1.1](https://xrdocs.github.io/application-hosting/tutorials/2016-08-22-using-puppet-with-iosxr-6-1-1 "Using Puppet with IOS-XR 6.1.1"). You will have to modify the example below to include the installation of the GRPC GEM file.

## Script Example
Here is a small example on how to use ZTP to download the and install the Puppet package from a local repository. the Puppet agent package is secured with a SHA-1 key, and you will need to download it to a secure location or access the key directly from Puppetlabs, in the example below I simply placed the key in the same directory as the RPM package.
Puppet requires all hostnames to be resolved, the script relies on a DNS server to resolve the hostname and include the modifications to IOS-XR Linux. The script also assumes that communication between the puppet master and the agent will happen over the management interface.

```
