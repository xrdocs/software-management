# Introduction
Network Services Orchestrator provides end-to-end orchestration that 
spans multiple domains in your network.

Using strict, standardized YANG models for both services and devices and a highly efficient abstraction layer between your network services and the underlying infrastructure, the orchestrator lets you automate all the multivendor devices.

## PnP

The NSO PnP Server is a NSO Component which enables management of Cisco PnP clients. The NSO PnP Server provides the Cisco PnP clients with configuration, typically configuration needed at the first boot of the client (Day-0 configuration).
